### How to accomodate big fonts?

- Wrap the text

- Labels overlapping each other when using constants for spacing?

  Spacing between labels can be dynaminc using: 

```swift
secondLabel.firstBaselineAnchor
		   .constraintEqualToSystemSpacingBelow(firstLabel.lastBaselineAnchor, 
		   										multiplier: 1.0)
```

^ It changes the spacing automatically based on the font size

---

- Alternate layout

	For side by side labels with large text size the labels should be moved to a vertical stack

	Example:

	```swift
	if traitCollection.preferredContentSizeCategory > .extraExtraLarge { 
		// Vertically stack
	} else {
		// Lay out side by side
	}
	```

	Note: Standard table view cells will handle it automatically.
